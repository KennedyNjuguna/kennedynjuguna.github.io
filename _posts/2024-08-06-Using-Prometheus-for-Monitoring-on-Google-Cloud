Monitoring is an important aspect of ensuring available workloads. In this project we will delve on the monitoring of a Kubernetes Cluster hosted on the Google Cloud Platform then deploy the Managed Service for Prometheus(to ingest metrics from a simple application) a Google Cloud's fully managed storage and query service for Prometheus metrics. This service is built on top of Monarch, the same globally scalable data store as Cloud Monitoring.

_Key highlights of our project:_

**Deploy the Managed Service for Prometheus to a GKE cluster.**
**Deploy a Python application to monitor.**
**Create a Cloud Monitoring dashboard to view metrics collected.**
