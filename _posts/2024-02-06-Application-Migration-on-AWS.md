# APPLICATION MIGRATION TO AWS


Welcome to this project!! In this Project we are going to lift and shift an application to the AWS cloud using the Appplication Migration Service. The objective is to show how an on-premise application is transferred to an the AWS Cloud seamlessly with its associated data and configurations. This ensures that your application experiences minimal disruptions while also leveraging the features that AWS has to offer.

***NB:*** **AS I AM NOT CURRENTLY HOSTING ON-PREM SERVERS, WE WILL LIFT AND SHIFT AN APPLICATION SERVER FROM THE AZURE CLOUD PLATFORM TAKING THE VMs CREATED IN AZURE AS THE ON-PREM SERVERS**

## STEPS I WILL TAKE
- Create Servers On-Prem (using Azure as the on-prem environment)
- Connect to the On-Prem server to install apps
- Create a replication server in AWS and download agent
- Install agent on the On-Prem Windows Server
- Launch replication; edit replication template, launch template and cutover template
- Launch the test process
- Cutover Process
