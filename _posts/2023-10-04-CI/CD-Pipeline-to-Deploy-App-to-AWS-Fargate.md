In the fast-paced realm of modern software development, the key to success lies in agility, precision, and the ability to deliver your applications swiftly and reliably. Picture a world where your code seamlessly transforms into running applications, effortlessly sailing through the intricate waters of cloud infrastructure—welcome to the "Create a CI/CD Pipeline to Deploy Your App to AWS Fargate" project documentation, your compass to this thrilling voyage.

Here, we wield the power of AWS CodePipeline to architect, choreograph, and visually narrate a three-stage pipeline—a conductor of sorts, orchestrating the deployment of a containerized application with finesse. Think of the blue/green deployment strategy like a safety net for your applications. It's like having a trusted friend by your side when you're making changes to your app. Here's how it works: When you want to update your application, instead of abruptly replacing the old version with the new one, you introduce the new version gently. It's like having two versions of your app, the old and the new, working together peacefully. Then, step by step, you start shifting more and more users to the new version. Imagine it as a careful dance, where you ensure the new code is doing well before fully committing to it. It's a bit like rehearsing a performance—you want to make sure everything goes smoothly. And here's the best part: If something doesn't go as planned and you discover issues in the new code, no worries! You can quickly and reliably switch back to the old version. It's like having an "undo" button for your updates. So, in simple terms, the blue/green deployment strategy is like a safety net that lets you update your app gracefully, test things out, and easily go back if needed. It's all about making changes with confidence and keeping your app running smoothly.

When complete, your pipeline automatically builds a new container image whenever new code is pushed to your source repository and then uses AWS CodeDeploy and Amazon ECS to manage its deployment and shift traffic to it.

TASK 1:

Open the Amazon ECS console, in the search box to the right of `Services`, search for and choose `ECS`

_Understanding tasks and services is critical for anyone who wants to manage or deploy applications on Amazon ECS. A task consists of one or more containers and their configuration that are scheduled by Amazon ECS. You can create tasks independently or as part of a service. When instantiated independently, a task launches containers, which run until such time as the task is ended or the containers exit. Upon termination, no further containers are launched. By contrast, services ensure that a specified number of tasks are running at all times. Services provide administrators with granular control over task placement and scaling and can be automatically associated with a load balancer_

Choose the FargateCluster link. Choose the Services tab and confirm that the FargateService is Active  and displays Tasks running. _Tasks running indicates that replicas of the application are running concurrently in your Amazon ECS cluster_

Choose the FargateService link.

At the top of the screen, choose the Deployments tab. The **Deployment type** should have been set to **CODE_DEPLOY**. This is a requirement for blue/green deployments launched on Fargate. With the **CODE_DEPLOY** deployment type, CodeDeploy can create a new green deployment, which runs in parallel with your existing blue deployment.
